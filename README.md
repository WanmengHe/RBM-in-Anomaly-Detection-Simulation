### Decoding Feature Vectors of Network Packets

What's this?
---
This project intends to implement GBRBM & RNN-RBM to decode a feature vector of network packets into a binary array, in order to discriminate the anomaly packets in network traffic.
It mainly focus on converting a real vector to a binary vector, which keep those vectors which contain anomaly values away from the normal vectors in the binary vector space.
